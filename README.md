# breakoutJS
one paddle, one ball and a brickwall - thats all you need!
A JavaScript implementation of the classic breakout game.

# Manual
The target of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle to make the bricks disappear. You have 3 lives - don't let the ball drop!\n
You can move the paddle to the left with your left Arrow-Key and to the right with the right Arrow-Key.

Have Fun!
